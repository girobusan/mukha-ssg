# Latid2

Next generation of Latid SSG. First tests, maybe I'll rename it finally.

## To change

- More or less universal markdown as source.
- Compact, structured code.
- Cleaner source structure.
- Themes.

**Project is on earliest stage, experimental, unusable.**

## Why bother?

- No tools required to install and run (exept node).
- Links are relative, site is extremely portable.
- Paginated lists.
- Custom or automatically generated pages for tags.
- Standart markdown + abilty to insert rich content.

## Plan

1. Convertor from L1
   - [x] blocks
   - [x] files
   - [ ] test on large site
2. CLI utility
   - [x] RSS
   - [x] New list mechanics
   - [x] Improved templating
   - [x] Pack SSG code to platform-agnostic module

- [x] Data attachment
- [ ] Data â†’ pages generation

3. [ ] Server & WebUI

## Tasks

- [x] Template data format
- [x] HTML postprocessing
- [x] Inserts syntax
